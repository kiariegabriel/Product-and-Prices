# Product-and-Prices
This program repeatedly asks the user to enter product names and prices. Store all of these in a dictionary whose keys are the product names and whose values are the prices. When the user is done entering products and prices, allow them to repeatedly enter a product name and print the corresponding price or a message if the product is not in the dictionary.
